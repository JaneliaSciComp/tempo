==================
Saving the Results
==================

There are a number of ways to save the results of your work in Tempo.  The primary way is to save the current window as a Tempo workspace.  You can also export one or all of the sets of features to a MATLAB or Excel file, export a selection of the video and audio to a movie file and take a screen shot of the window.

Tempo Workspaces
----------------

Saving a tempo workspace preserves every aspect of what you have done in Tempo and allows you to open up your work again later.  All video, audio and annotations are remembered along with which panels are in use and their various settings.

---------------
Export Features
---------------

The annotations being displayed in :doc:`feature panels </UserInterface/FeaturesPanel>` can be saved to MATLAB or Excel files.  To export a single set of features choose :menuselection:`Export Features...` from the action menu (the little gear icon) of the panel.  To export all features from all panels choose :menuselection:`File -> Export All Features...`.

-------------------------
Export Selection to Movie
-------------------------

You can use this feature to combine your video and audio files.  Select some part of the timeline and then choose :menuselection:`File -> Export Video of Selection...' or click the equivalent toolbar icon.  If you have more than one video file open then only the first one will be exported.
